# RSRV
Rib Support Recommendation Tool

If MATLAB is already installed on your computer, you can directly use the “Exe_file_only” file to run the RSR tool. If you don't have MATLAB or the MATLAB runtime installed on your computer, use the “RSRV1.001_web_Installer” to install both MATLAB runtime and the RSR tool on your computer. Note that an internet connection is required to download MATLAB runtime.
